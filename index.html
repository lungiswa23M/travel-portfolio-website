        <h2>Why Paris?</h2>
        <h3>Paris, the city of love</h3>
        <p>
            Among the long list of things the city of Paris is known for, its nickname as the City of Love is the most romantic.
            But is it because it is the perfect honeymoon destination for the newly-weds and the escape place to commemorate long-term love?
            It is not quite clear if people usually propose there because Paris is the City of Love or that Paris is the city of Love because 
            people often propose there. In any case, the Eiffel Tower is the second most popular place in the world where lovers
            propose after Central Park In New York. It is not hard to tell if you see the shining in the evening- absolutely gorgeous.
            French is known as the sexiest language in the world, French is part of why Paris is the City of Love. 
            The language is a syllable-timed one rather than stress-timed, like English. This means all the syllables take almost equal duration
            to pronounce, making is sound symphonic.
            In addition, native French speakers have a type of husky voice that people find attractive for both men and women.

           Native French speakers have a type of husky voice that people find attractive for both men and women. The language is just pleasant to the ear.
           And with “Je t’aime” sounding in streets and shops, it is not difficult to feel the spirit of love in Paris. It might be pretty clear, 
           but the general beauty and style of Paris with its massive buildings blending architectural styles give the city a distinct atmosphere.
           The palaces, monuments, and churches are all exquisite and imposing. As an incredibly romantic city, it is vital that Paris has a spot that shows the pure emotion of love. 
           That is why the city has a Wall of Love.
